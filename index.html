        <h1>Evangeline Yo</h1>
        <h2>Undergraduate student in UBC</h2>

        <p>
          Hello, my name is Evangeline Yo, and I am a third-year student, majoring in Combined Computer Science and Mathematics.
           While my journey in this field is still in its early stages, I am deeply fascinated by the potential of data-driven insights and predictive modeling to revolutionize industries and solve complex problems.
            I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to advancements in both areas in the future.
             Alongside my studies, I actively seek out learning opportunities, attend workshops, and engage in hands-on projects to gain practical experience. 
             With a curious mind and a dedication to continuous learning, I am determined to make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving world of data science and machine learning.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>Hello, my name is Evangeline Yo, and I am a passionate student pursuing a combined major in Computer Science
          and Mathematics in University of British Columbia.
          Originally from Taipei, Taiwan, I have embarked on a journey to explore the intersection of these two fields.
          With a keen interest in problem-solving and analytical thinking, I have developed a foundation in programming
          language and algorithms.
          My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology
          and make a positive impact on people's lives.</p> -->
        <!-- Alongside my academic pursuits, I actively engage in various coding projects and willing to participate in programming competitions in the future. -->

          <p>
            This project is designed to manage drink orders  by using Java and Java GUI.
             It offers several functionalities, including order taking, charge calculation, mark orders that are ready for delivery, and the creation of a waiting list and a list of completed orders. 
            Users can modify the waiting list by removing orders and make changes to existing orders, such as updating customer details (name and address) or modifying the drinks in the order. 
            The project supports saving and loading the lists and records, allowing for easy management and retrieval of data.</p>
